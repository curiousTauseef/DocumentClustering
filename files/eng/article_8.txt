Authorities: Pair found dead in apparent murder-suicide
PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Authorities say two people found dead in a Philadelphia home died in an apparent murder-suicide.

But it's still not clear what sparked the shooting that occurred around 4:45 p.m. Wednesday.

Neighbors said they heard arguing in the home before several gunshots were fired. Authorities say the victim was shot nine times, but they haven't said what type of weapon was used.

The names of the shooter and the victim have not been released. Authorities also have not disclosed whether the two were related.
