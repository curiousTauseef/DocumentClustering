Residents of Drobo, Japekrom plead for lifting of curfew
Residents of the eight communities including Drobo and Japekrom are pleading with the government to lift the curfew placed on the communities.

Speaking to Joy News, the Coordinating Director of Jaman South Municipal Assembly, Joseph Anoma said the curfew which is in its fourth week, is having a toll on the economic activities in the area.

"We have economic activities that take place at night and this curfew is restricting a lot of such activities which is affecting incomes of workers," he said.

Mr. Anoma explained the curfew has also restricted the Assembly's revenue collection because the people cannot cross over to other towns.

"The cost of keeping the security personnel is also costing huge sums of money," he added.

The curfew on Drobo, Japekrom and eight other communities was imposed after clashes between residents of Drobo and Japekrom led to the death of three people.

Residents particularly nurses, teachers, and traders say the curfew is affecting their work and they are pleading with the government to review the situation.

One male health worker told Joy News they do not get to treat as many patients as they should because of the imposed curfew.

"As a nurse, I need to come before six and close after six, with the situation at hand we have to close before 6 pm and we have to leave our houses after am reducing work hours which negatively affect health care delivery," he stated.

A female health worker complained that getting home before the curfew is a problem because the hospital at some time cannot close at 6 pm.

She said, "we were intercepted by some soldiers while going home after 6 pm and we had to explain to them we were nurses who just closed before they let us go."

One teacher said the dusk to dawn curfew has limited activities on school campuses because they arrive late and go early. "The time is too small to finish the day's work".
