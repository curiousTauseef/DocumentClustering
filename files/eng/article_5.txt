AWCON 2018: Equatorial Guinea replaces Kenya after appeal
Kenya will not participate in the upcoming women's Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana after the Confederation of African Football (Caf) reinstated Equatorial Guinea who were initially disqualified from the competition.

Kenya took the place of Equatorial Guinea after successfully protesting against them for fielding an unqualified player during the qualifiers.

But Equatorial Guinea appealed the decision and CAF yesterday ruled in their favor and has now stripped off Kenya the rights to participate in the competition and instead, reinstated Equatorial Guinea.

The two-time champions will now slot into Group B to replace the East Africans.

Kenya had been preparing for the competition and drew 1-1 against Ghana in a friendly on Wednesday.

The tournament will kick off on November 17 here in Ghana.
