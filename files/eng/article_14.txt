Yemeni forces fires ballistic missile at Saudi mercenaries
AhlulBayt News Agency (ABNA): The Yemeni army ad Popular Committees, in a retaliatory attack against the Saudi-led coalition, fired a domestically made ballistic missile at a gathering of foreign-backed mercenaries in the Arabian Peninsula country's northern province of Jawf, local reports said.

The missile command of the Yemeni army and Popular Committees announced that they targeted a military base of the Saudi-Emirati mercenaries in Jawf on Wednesday night with a ballistic missile dubbed "Badr-1", the Arabic-language al-Masirah TV reported.

A Yemeni military source said the missile hit the enemy target precisely and inflicted heavy casualties on the mercenaries.

The attack came in retaliation for the continued massacre of civilians and destruction of Yemen's infrastructure by the coalition led by the Riyadh regime.

Yemen's defenseless people have been under massive attacks by the coalition for more than three-and-a-half years but Riyadh has reached none of its objectives in Yemen so far.

Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and some of its Arab allies have been carrying out deadly airstrikes against the Houthi Ansarullah movement in an attempt to restore power to fugitive former president Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh.

The Yemeni Ministry of Human Rights announced in a statement on March 25 that the war had left 600,000 civilians dead and injured until then. The war and the accompanying blockade have also caused famine across Yemen.
